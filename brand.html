        <h2>Own The Label™</h2>
        <p>
          Own The Label is the by-product of a dream and vision that began with a student collector, Jabez Celestino,
          in 2025. With a love for clothing brands and a simple idea—what if apparel could be customized as freely as
          Crocs with Jibbitz?—he sought to create a brand that breaks boundaries of self-expression.
        </p>
        <p>
          Originally named MYB (Make Your Brand), the idea evolved when inspiration struck from someone special in
          Jabez’s life. That spark led to the name Own The Label, a reflection of its true mission: to give everyone
          the same brand, but never the same look.
        </p>
        <p>
          With the help of his closest friends—Frank Solis, Jireh Salvame, and Miguel Eudela—Jabez brought the vision
          to life, starting with the creation of their very own website. Together, they set out to redefine apparel as
          more than clothing—it’s a canvas.
        </p>
        <p>
          Specializing in comfortable shirts, hoodies, and other essentials, Own The Label allows customers to
          personalize their pieces with embroidered, chenille, and other unique patches. The brand isn’t just about
          wearing clothes; it’s about wearing your story, your creativity, and your individuality.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since day one, Own The Label has stood for freedom of expression, originality, and identity. It’s not just
          fashion—it’s a community of people who believe that style should reflect who you truly are.
        </p>
        <p>
          As the brand continues to grow, Own The Label remains committed to evolving with its supporters, cultivating a
          culture where everyone can truly own their label.
